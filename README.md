# Neighborhood Analysis of Dessert Venues in SF South Bay Area

My capstone project for IBM Data Science course on Coursera. We were suggested to use foursquare.com's open API of venues data and come up with a topic to solve using data science.

Please see my [presentation](https://github.com/boriopas/ds-capstone-project/blob/master/Dessert_Project_Presentation.pdf) for quick overview of my work, follow by my [report](https://github.com/boriopas/ds-capstone-project/blob/master/Dessert_Project_Report.pdf) for complete description. My [code](https://github.com/boriopas/ds-capstone-project/blob/master/Dessert_Project.ipynb) is also made available as a Jupyter Notebook.

Thanks for visiting!
